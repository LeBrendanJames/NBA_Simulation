TODO:
1. BUILD TESTS
	- Way overdue on this. Terrible software engineering to not have these done.
2. Move game initialization out of simulation loop
	- The bottleneck in speed currently is initializing all the players since there's a lot of database calls in that
	- Those advanced stats don't change during a game simulation so it should only have to be done once
3. Better estimate player advanced stats
	- This begins with passing gmState down to the player constructor so that info about the game can be used in estimating stats (game date, H/A, etc.)
	- Then, this is largely a statistics question of how best to project future performance
4. Fill database
	- With previous seasons data
	- With rosters (how to do this by date, like when a team signs a player mid-season?)
	- With prev_play data
5. Simulate game better
	- Far too simple right now
	- Update fouling (bonus for 2FT's, etc.)
	- Update time calcs
	- Big one is team interaction (subs, etc. - requires working on Team and Coach objects)
