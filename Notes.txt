TODO:
1. BUILD TESTS
	- Way overdue on this. Terrible software engineering to not have these done.
	- Better documentation too
2. Better estimate player advanced stats
	- This is largely a statistics question of how best to project future performance rather than a programming issue
	- At player level, need to take into account who past possessions have been played with
		- This becomes a little circular, though, because you would then ideally like to know who those players have played with as well
		- Could I use something like the regressions I did in Excel that try to attribute change in advanced stat percentages by player on court?
3. Fill database
	- With previous seasons data
	- With rosters (how to do this by date, like when a team signs a player mid-season?)
	- With prev_play data
4. Simulate game better
	- Far too simple right now
	- Update fouling (bonus for 2FT's, etc.)
	- Update time calcs
	- Big one is team interaction (subs, etc. - requires working on Team and Coach objects)
