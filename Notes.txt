TODO:
1. BUILD TESTS
	- Way overdue on this. Terrible software engineering to not have these done.
2. Move game initialization out of simulation loop
	- The bottleneck in speed currently is initializing all the players since there's a lot of database calls in that
	- Those advanced stats don't change during a game simulation so it should only have to be done once
	- One way to do this would be to create a Game object then within the loop copy all the info over to a new game object 
	which is used for the simulation then deleted
		- This would require writing all the copy constructors
3. Better estimate player advanced stats
	- This is largely a statistics question of how best to project future performance rather than a programming issue
4. Fill database
	- With previous seasons data
	- With rosters (how to do this by date, like when a team signs a player mid-season?)
	- With prev_play data
5. Simulate game better
	- Far too simple right now
	- Update fouling (bonus for 2FT's, etc.)
	- Update time calcs
	- Big one is team interaction (subs, etc. - requires working on Team and Coach objects)
